- Use them as your portfolio
- (Recommendation) Add your ongoing accomplishments to GitHub as part of your resume/portfolio: this is critical as a professional.

2. Submit the code & presentation

- Submission directory structure:
  - `code/` (Laravel app + Docker files + scripts + anything you did for the stage 2)  
  - `presentation/` (Markdown files for Hugo site + deployment docs + anything you did for the stage 2)  
  - `plan/` (Copy your HW4 project plan with updates)
